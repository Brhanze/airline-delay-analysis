# Airline Operations and Delay Analysis Using 2014 US Flight Data

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze 2014 US flight data to understand airline operations, with a focus on identifying patterns related to flight delays and cancellations. Using Python and machine learning techniques, the project explores various airlines' performance and builds a predictive model to anticipate flight delays.

## Tools and Techniques
- **Python Libraries**: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
- **Techniques**: Data Cleaning, EDA, Feature Engineering, Random Forest Classifier, Visualizations

## Key Insights
- Alaska Airlines (AS) is the busiest and most punctual airline.
- The SEA-LAX route is the most frequently flown.
- Frontier Airlines (F9) has the longest average delays.
- Only 0.6% of flights were canceled overall, but cancellation rates vary by airline.
- A delay prediction model with 94% accuracy and 80% F1-score was developed.
