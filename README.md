# ✈️ Airline Delay Analysis

This project analyzes flight delay data to uncover patterns in airline performance and airport operations. It identifies the most frequent causes of delays and provides visual insights to help improve scheduling, route optimization, and passenger satisfaction.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze delay trends across airports, airlines, and timeframes
- Visualize patterns in arrival and departure delays
- Determine key factors contributing to flight delays
- Provide data-driven recommendations for minimizing delays

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Languages**: Python  
- **Libraries**: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, NumPy  
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Power BI (if used)

---

## 📈 Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing** – Cleaned and transformed flight data
2. **Exploratory Analysis** – Visualized delay frequency by airline, month, and destination
3. **Correlation Analysis** – Identified factors influencing delays
4. **Results Interpretation** – Ranked worst-performing carriers and peak delay times

---

## 📊 Results

- Airlines with highest average delays identified
- Delay spikes during winter months and holiday weekends
- Weather and airport traffic shown to be significant contributors

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add machine learning model to predict flight delays
- Include weather and air traffic as external features
- Deploy interactive dashboard using Streamlit
